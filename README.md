Kaggle Avito competition [[link]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-duplicate-ads-detection)

Avito.ru is a Russian website where people sell things. They have one problem: people create several ads for the same product to make it more visible. The idea is to detect duplicate advertisements. We use text mining, image and other techniques.

Our code outranks the official Avito.ru score. We did not have the time to improve further.

See [our wiki](https://github.com/rpmcruz/avito/wiki) for more information.
